# django-survey-app
This is a sample survey application built on [django-admin](https://github.com/django/django/tree/master/django/contrib/admin) following the [Django quick start tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/). This is a SPA built using django-framework where users can participate in surveys created by the administrator of the application. Each user participation is tracked by the administrator and is provided with visualizations on choice distributions for each question in the application. The administration dashboard is an extension of admin templates available in [django-admin](https://github.com/django/django/tree/master/django/contrib/admin). 
### [Checkout the demo application hosted on heroku](https://fast-brushlands-08121.herokuapp.com/survey/). 
Use admin/admin as credentials to login to admin page.

## Features:
 - The polls application is extended to a survey where admin can create multiple surveys with multiple questions and choices for each question.
 - The dashboard is enriched with a statistics widget. The widget displays the popular survey among the surveys and the bar chart visualization of vote distributions among different choices for a question.
 - The application is a SPA with 5 Views on the Users App and a dashboard for the administrator. Partial Views are implemented with a custom middleware view 'index' which further routes URL requests.
 - Created two REST endpoints and used them from admin through AJAX calls.
 
## Installation and Launching the application

Navigate to the project directory (where manage.py is located) and run

  ```
#### Create schema for models incorporated in survey app. (The sql script returned can be used shared across teams)
